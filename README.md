# Finders Keepers - You now own this tag

Why did you scan a random nfc tag? I suppose I could lecture you on why that's a sketchy idea, but I'm not your mom.. 

Anyhow, finders keepers - this tag is yours now.

### Ideas for your new tag, if you've never had one before...

- Auto-connect to some wifi (because that password is just too hard to remember)
- Share some media (you can link to a picture of a [cat](https://cdn2.thecatapi.com/images/vJB8rwfdX.jpg) )
- Open a youtube video (here's a [good one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) )
- Automate stuff in your home
- Set a timer for perfectly cooked hard boiled eggs
- Give your contact info to a new friend
- Link to your portfolio or LinkedIn
- ... or whatever else you can think of :)


### How do you program it?

There's lots of fancy ways to do it, but `NFC Tools` is my favorite to program these:
- [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wakdev.wdnfc&hl=en_US&gl=US)
- [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nfc-tools/id1252962749)

### How did I make this?

Model was created by GeekToyBox and you can find it [here](https://www.printables.com/model/505531-25mm1-nfc-ntag215-coin-keychain).  I used whatever NFC tags that I had at the time of printing (stickers, coins, whatever..depends on the day).  The model's creator linked some nfc tags that also work, so I'd recommend those.  To emboss my logo, I just used the feature in the PrusaSlicer to add part > SVG.  Lastly, I printed these with my Prusa MK4.
